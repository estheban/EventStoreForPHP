# PHP Event Store Client library for [GetEventStore](http://geteventstore.com)

This is a ~~draft~~, work in progress, an experiment of implementation of a client library for [GetEventStore](http://geteventstore.com)

It is heavily inspired (and by some accounts generated from) the .NET client library.
